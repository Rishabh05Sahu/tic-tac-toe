Customizable Tic Tac Toe
Project Overview
The Customizable Tic-Tac-Toe Game is a modern twist on the classic game, allowing players to define the grid size (3x3 to 10x10) and the winning streak required (3 to n). It features a responsive design, real-time game status updates, and a seamless user experience.

Built with React and styled using Tailwind CSS, the project demonstrates modular component-based architecture and robust game logic, handling turn-taking, winner checks, and game restarts efficiently. This interactive game is perfect for showcasing React skills and delivering an engaging user experience.
